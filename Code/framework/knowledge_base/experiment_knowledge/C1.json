  "Task Description": "Graph Regression with ZINC dataset. Graph regression task aimed at predicting the constrained solubility of molecules. The task involves calculating the molecular property known as logP (octanol-water partition coefficients), penalized by synthetic accessibility score (SA) and the number of long cycles (cycle), which are critical for assessing the biological activity of molecules.",
  "Dataset Description": "The ZINC dataset includes 12K molecular graphs, which are a subset extracted from a larger collection of 250K molecules. Each molecular graph's nodes represent heavy atoms and edges represent the chemical bonds between them.",
  "Performance Summary": {
    "General": "The performance overview indicates varied success across different GNN models on the ZINC dataset, with the GatedGCN-E-PE model showing optimal performance when incorporating edge features and positional encodings.",
