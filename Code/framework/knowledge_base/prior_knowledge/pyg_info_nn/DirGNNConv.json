        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown impressive capabilities across numerous domains. However, many GNN models primarily focus on undirected graphs, leaving the potential of directed graphs underexplored, particularly in heterophilic contexts where neighboring nodes often differ in labels. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a novel framework for extending GNNs to directed graphs, enhancing their expressive power and effectiveness in heterophilic environments.",

The framework involves accounting for edge directionality, offering a more expressive GNN model that performs well on tasks where traditional models struggle.",

        "research challenge": "Standard GNNs may fail in heterophilic settings by assuming homophily, which means neighboring nodes are likely related. Our challenge is to adapt GNN models to better handle heterophilic environments found in many real-world directed graphs, thereby utilizing the valuable information contained in edge directions.",
