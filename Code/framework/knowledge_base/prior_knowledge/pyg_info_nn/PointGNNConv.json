        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel object detection framework, Point-GNN, based on graph neural networks (GNN) for detecting 3D objects in point cloud data. Unlike conventional methods which map point clouds to a grid, our approach leverages the natural representation of graphs to better preserve irregularities in point cloud data for object detection. We propose an auto-registration mechanism reducing translation variance and introduce an efficient box merging and scoring strategy. Evaluations on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing traditional and sensor fusion methods, underscoring Point-GNN's potential as a strong baseline for 3D detection research.",

Compared to methods using set-based techniques, Point-GNN avoids repetitive sampling, improving computation efficiency."
