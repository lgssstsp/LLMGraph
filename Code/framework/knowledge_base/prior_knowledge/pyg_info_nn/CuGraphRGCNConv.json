        "abstract": "Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) are proposed as a new model for addressing two classical tasks in statistical relational learning with knowledge bases: link prediction and entity classification. By adapting the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to relational data, R-GCNs capture the interdependencies across multiple relations in a knowledge base. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that R-GCNs achieve competitive results, highlighting their efficacy in effectively modeling relational data.",
