By systematically evaluating over 10 million possible model-task combinations, we show that instead of focusing on specific GNN architectures, it is beneficial to explore the broader design and task spaces. Utilizing a standardized platform called \\texttt{GraphGym}, our approach provides new insights into effective GNN design across a multiplicity of diverse graph-related tasks.",
