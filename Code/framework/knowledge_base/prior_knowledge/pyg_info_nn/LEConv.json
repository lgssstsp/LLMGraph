ASAP enhances GNN capability by capturing local substructure information, crucial for effective hierarchical learning in graph-level tasks. This method leverages a new self-attention mechanism called Master2Token for better node membership capturing and proposes Local Extrema Convolution for adaptive cluster scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate ASAP's superior performance over existing methods across various datasets.",
