        "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a standard approach for graph-based learning tasks. However, these models inherit the complexity of deep learning methods and often prove cumbersome for applications requiring efficiency and interpretability. We propose \\Method{}, a simplified linear version of GCNs by removing activation functions and collapsing graph convolution layers. Despite its simplicity, \\Method{} matches or surpasses GCNs in performance across several tasks, while achieving significant reductions in computational time and memory usage.",
