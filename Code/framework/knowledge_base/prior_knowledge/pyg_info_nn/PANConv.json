        "abstract": "Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results across various domains. This paper introduces a novel GNN framework called PAN (Path Integral Based Graph Neural Network), which generalizes the graph convolution process by integrating the path integral formulation. Unlike traditional methods relying solely on random walks, PAN evaluates every path between nodes with trainable weights, offering a rich model capable of capturing complex node interactions. PAN shows superior performance to existing models on several benchmark datasets and provides a robust foundation for analyzing networks from physical to social domains.",
