        "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have predominantly been applied to unsigned graphs; however, the rise of online social media underscores the importance of handling signed graphs. This paper introduces a Signed Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) that effectively integrates signed network social theories, most notably balance theory, to learn meaningful node embeddings. This approach involves redesigning GCNs to handle negative links intelligently, conducting evaluations on real-world signed networks, and demonstrating the superiority of SGCN against state-of-the-art baselines in signed network analyses.",

        "related papers": "Research efforts into signed network embedding stem from social psychology, leveraging theories such as balance theory [Heider-1946]. Notable works include SNE [Yuan-etal2017], which uses log-bilinear models, SiNE [Wang-etal2017], a deep neural network model based on balance theory, and others focusing on matrix factorization techniques [Kunegis-etal2010]. Graph Convolutional Networks, pioneered by Kipf and Welling [2016], have shaped much of the recent developments in node representation learning.",
        "comparisons with related methods": "Existing methods like SiNE and SIDE showed promise in exploiting balance theory; however, their complexities are higher compared to GCN-based architectures. GCNs, while focused on unsigned graphs, set the foundation for the inclusion of graph-specific convolutional operations, adapted by SGCN to encompass signed network attributes effectively."
