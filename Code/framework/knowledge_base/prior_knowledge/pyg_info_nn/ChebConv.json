In this work, we propose mathematical foundations and computational techniques to efficiently generalize CNNs to graphs. We achieve this by leveraging spectral graph theory to define localized graph filters. We offer an evaluation strategy which scales linearly with the graph edges, preserving memory efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model in various tasks, achieving superior accuracy compared to existing spectral CNN models on graphs.",
