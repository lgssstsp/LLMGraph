        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in a variety of tasks; however, they often suffer from high computational cost. We introduce an Efficient Graph Convolutional (EGC) architecture that challenges the conventional necessity of anisotropy in high-performing GNNs. Our work demonstrates that isotropic models, which are less expressive according to conventional wisdom, can indeed achieve or surpass the performance of their anisotropic counterparts while maintaining efficiency. By reducing computational complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(V)$ and integrating this with optimization across varied domains, our novel EGC model promises both scalability and superior performance.",
