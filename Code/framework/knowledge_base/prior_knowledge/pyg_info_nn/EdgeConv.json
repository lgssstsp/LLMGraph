        "abstract": "The fast acquisition of 3D point cloud data has sparked the interest in processing these data structures instead of converting them into meshes or other representations. Despite their potential, point clouds present unique challenges for machine learning algorithms, like irregular structures and permutation invariance. This paper introduces the novel method EdgeConv, which addresses these limitations and improves the representation and segmentation tasks performed on point cloud data.",

While MoNet and other graph CNNs assume a given fixed graph on which convolution-like operations are applied, to our knowledge our method is the first for which the graph changes from layer to layer and even on the same input during training when learnable parameters are updated."
