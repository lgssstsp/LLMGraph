        "abstract": "PPFNet is an end-to-end deep learning framework designed to learn fast and robust 3D local feature descriptors. These descriptors exhibit increased tolerance to rotations and enable accurate 3D tasks such as correspondence estimation, object detection, and shape retrieval. By leveraging surface points, normals, and point pair features (PPF), and employing a novel N-tuple loss function, PPFNet effectively learns discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate PPFNet's state-of-the-art performance in robustness and speed.",
