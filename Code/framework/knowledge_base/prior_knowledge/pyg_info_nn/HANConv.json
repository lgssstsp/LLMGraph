        "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) is a powerful deep representation learning method ideal for graph data like social and citation networks. It excels in network analysis and has spurred substantial research curiosity. Among GNNs, the Graph Attention Network (GAT) introduced a novel convolution-style that utilizes attention mechanisms effectively, catering to homogeneous graphs with single node or link types. Nevertheless, the prevalent real-world graphs, which are often heterogeneous with diverse nodes and relationship types, demand more comprehensive solutions. This paper presents a novel approach exploring attention-based GNN frameworks specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs, acknowledging the complexity and semantic richness they offer.",

        "comparisons with related methods": "Previous works have successfully introduced attention in homogeneous network settings using GAT. Techniques like DeepWalk and metapath2vec focus on homogeneous contexts. In contrast to these, our proposed HAN effectively handles both node and semantic-level attention, permitting nuanced understanding of heterogeneous graphs. Key differences include HAN's capacity to dynamically learn the importance of diverse node-neighbors and meta-paths, improving classification and interpretability significantly."
