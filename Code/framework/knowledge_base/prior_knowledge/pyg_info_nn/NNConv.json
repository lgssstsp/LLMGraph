        "abstract": "This paper introduces Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), a unified and general framework for supervised learning on graphs. MPNNs are designed to learn molecular graph representations directly, with invariance to graph isomorphism, thus eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The framework abstractly unifies several existing graph neural network models, laying the foundation for effective graph-based learning applications in domains such as chemistry and materials science. Extensive experiments demonstrate MPNNs' superior performance on the QM9 dataset, achieving chemical accuracy for most targets, highlighting MPNNs' potential as a standard in material property prediction tasks.",
