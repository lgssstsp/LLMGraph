This paper presents an extension of GNNs that can produce sequences of outputs, which is crucial for solving tasks requiring sequential outputs from graph-structured inputs. Our model, called \\OurMethods~(\\OurMethodShorts), is particularly useful for problems in machine learning, such as program verification, that deal with graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of \\OurMethods~on bAbI tasks and practical applications in program verification, showcasing its ability to output sequences effectively.",
