        "abstract": "This paper introduces the Topology Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (TAGCN), a unified convolutional neural network designed to learn nonlinear representations for graph-structured data. Unlike conventional CNNs limited to grid-structured inputs, TAGCN effectively processes data on arbitrary graphs, leveraging topology-adaptive filters simultaneously on the graph. These filters output a weighted sum that captures vertex features and connections. TAGCN unifies both spectral and vertex domain filtering, applicable to directed and undirected graphs, providing a robust theoretical foundation for graph convolutional operations.",
