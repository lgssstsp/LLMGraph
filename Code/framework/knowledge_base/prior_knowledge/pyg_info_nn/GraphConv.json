        "abstract": "This research paper explores the relationship between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) kernels, showing that while GNNs cannot surpass the $1$-WL in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs, they can match its expressiveness with suitable initialization. We propose $k$-GNNs, generalized forms of GNNs, which utilize higher-dimensional WL variants to provide greater distinguishing power. We further introduce hierarchical variants that enhance performance on real-world hierarchical graphs. Our experiments demonstrate the empirical advantages of our methods over baseline kernels and GNN models.",
