        "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown promise in learning from graph-structured data. However, most GCNs are shallow, achieving optimal performance with 2-layer architectures, limiting their capacity to capture information from high-order neighbors. Stacking more layers typically leads to over-smoothing, wherein node representations become indistinguishable. This paper presents GCNII, a deep GCN model that resolves over-smoothing through initial residual connections and identity mappings. Experimental results confirm that GCNII improves performance consistently as network depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art results in both semi-supervised and full-supervised tasks.",
