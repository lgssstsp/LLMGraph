        "abstract": "This paper introduces two novel operators for graph neural networks: hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention, tailored for learning with non-pairwise hypergraph data structures. Traditional convolutional neural networks tend to operate on regular and grid-like data structures, limiting their application on irregular and non-pairwise structured data often found in real-world applications. This research presents methodologies that extend the functionality of graph neural networks to hypergraphs, facilitating the modeling of higher-order object relationships naturally occurring in various domains.",
