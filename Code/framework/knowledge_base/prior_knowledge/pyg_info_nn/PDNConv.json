        "abstract": "We introduce Pathfinder Discovery Networks (PDNs), a novel neural network framework for graph-based learning tasks. PDNs construct optimized message-passing graphs from multiple proximity inputs and learn these graphs in parallel with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance performance on node classification tasks. Our pathfinder layer combines varied proximity data within a neural network architecture, offering significant advantages over conventional methods such as Graph Attention Networks (GATs). We empirically validate our approach, demonstrating improvements in predictive accuracy and interpretability on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
