        "abstract": "In this paper, we present advancements in 3D point cloud analysis by developing a Point Transformer network, inspired by the Transformer model's success in natural language processing and image analysis. Utilizing self-attention mechanisms, our approach is naturally suited to point clouds, which are inherently unordered and scattered in 3D space. The model exhibits state-of-the-art performance across various 3D vision tasks, bolstered by the Point Transformer layer's capacity to encode position information efficiently and operate on local neighborhoods in a permutation-invariant manner.",
