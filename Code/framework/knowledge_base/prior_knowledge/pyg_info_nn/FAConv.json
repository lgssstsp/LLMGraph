        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional network, FAGCN, to address the problem of learning node representations in graphs with both homophilic and heterophilic structures. Existing graph neural networks are limited in their ability to capture both high-frequency (heterophilic) and low-frequency (homophilic) signals. FAGCN introduces a self-gating mechanism, allowing it to adaptively determine the importance of low- and high-frequency signals for each node. The method leverages theoretical insights from graph signal processing to effectively balance the use of information across different types of networks. Our experiments demonstrate that FAGCN significantly improves performance on a variety of real-world graphs compared to existing GNN methods.",
