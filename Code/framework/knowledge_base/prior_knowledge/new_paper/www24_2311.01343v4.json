        "abstract": "The paper presents CLLM4Rec, a novel generative recommender system designed to integrate the strengths of ID-based and language model-based recommendation paradigms. This work leverages the powerful capabilities of pretrained large language models (LLMs) by extending their vocabulary with user/item IDs to faithfully capture collaborative and content semantics in recommendation data. Through mutually-regularized pretraining and recommendation-specific finetuning, CLLM4Rec efficiently utilizes comprehensive textual and interaction data for superior recommendation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
