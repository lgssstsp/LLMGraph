        "abstract": "Recommendation models have become integral to many online platforms, providing personalized user experiences by predicting future item interactions based on users' historical behavior sequences. However, traditional models often overlook the nuances of multi-behavior user interactions, treating different types of user actions in isolation. This work introduces the Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced Transformer (MBHT), a novel framework designed to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies across various types of user-item interactions. The MBHT leverages a multi-scale Transformer module to encode varying granularities of sequential behaviors, combined with hypergraph neural architecture to encapsulate complex multi-order behavior dependencies, delivering substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "comparisons with related methods": "The proposed MBHT framework addresses limitations in traditional and state-of-the-art recommendation models such as SASRec and BERT4Rec through effective modeling of multi-behavior user interactions. Traditional models often ignore the complexity and diversity of user behaviors, treating different actions independently. By incorporating hypergraph structure and multi-scale attention mechanisms, MBHT captures multi-order dependencies across behaviors, improving long-term accuracy in sequence-based recommendations."
