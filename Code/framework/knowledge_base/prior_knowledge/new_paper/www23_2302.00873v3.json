        "abstract": "The prevalence of graph-structured data in the real world, such as social networks, financial networks, and citation networks, poses challenges due to incomplete node features and unavailable labels. These challenges create what is known as the 'data-hungry problem' for graphs, particularly for 'silent nodes.' The paper introduces Knowledge Transferable Graph Neural Network (KTGNN), which aims to predict the silent majority by transferring knowledge from vocal nodes on a VS-Graph. By employing a Domain-Adapted Feature Complementor (DAFC), Domain-Adapted Message Passing (DAMP), and Domain Transferable Classifier (DTC), KTGNN models and preserves distribution shifts to improve prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art networks.",

This approach effectively blends the benefits of domain adaptation and feature completion strategies."
