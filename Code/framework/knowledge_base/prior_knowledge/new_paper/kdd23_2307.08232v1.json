        "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of learning counterfactually fair predictors from observational data in scenarios where causal models are unknown. Existing methods often require predefined causal models to ensure fairness, which is impractical in real-world settings where such models are hard to obtain. We introduce a novel framework that learns counterfactually fair representations without relying on explicit causal models. To achieve this, we combine counterfactual data augmentation with fair representation learning under non-discriminatory constraints, overcoming the limitations of traditional fairness through unawareness methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving superior fairness and prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
