        "abstract": "In the digital age, online social networks proliferate, leading to various social phenomena such as polarization, echo chambers, and resistance. We address optimizing these phenomena by adjusting the opinions of select individuals within a network. Using a supermodular framework, we propose two efficient greedy algorithms to minimize conflict measures, controversy, and resistance, and validate their performance using real-world networks.",
