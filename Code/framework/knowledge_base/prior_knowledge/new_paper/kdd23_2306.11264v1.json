        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), as a model class based on the message passing principle, show promising efficacy for learning node representations for graph-structured data, used in physics simulation, traffic prediction, and drug recommendation. However, issues such as spurious and unobserved edges affect outcomes. Graph structure learning remedies this by optimizing structures and classifiers concurrently. Current methods are limited as they rely on a closed-world hypothesis, which is dependent on discovering structure from the same graph in training and testing scenarios. We propose a novel open-world setting targeting a generalizable model trained across multiple source graphs, adapting directly to unseen target graphs through bi-level optimization without re-training. This research introduces a structure learner to leverage transferrable knowledge and enhance generalization.",
