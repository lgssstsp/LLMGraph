        "abstract": "Crowdsourced annotations provide a cost-effective means for gathering labeled data; however, the sparsity of such annotations often compromises the quality of training datasets for machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CrowdInG, which leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate informative annotations from sparse datasets, increasing label density without incurring additional cost. The CrowdInG framework outperforms existing methods in sparse annotation scenarios by strategically generating annotations that align with authentic confusion patterns and boost classifier training efficiency.",
