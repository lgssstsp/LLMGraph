        "abstract": "Nowadays, many web-based services benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) and the large volume of data generated locally on various clients. However, due to privacy concerns, centralized AI faces significant challenges. Federated learning (FL) is proposed to utilize local data without sharing private information. To address the challenge of statistical heterogeneity, personalized federated learning (pFL) focuses on learning personalized models instead of a single global model. Existing pFL methods often only exploit global/personalized information in model parameters. We propose a Federated Conditional Policy (Method) based on conditional computing techniques to separate global and personalized information in data. Our auxiliary Conditional Policy Network generates sample-specific policies for feature separation, which are processed by a global and a personalized head. Our approach outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods across various settings and adapts to unstable client participations.",

        "comparisons with related methods": "The proposed method differs from FedAvg in its ability to customize individual client models to address statistical heterogeneity problems. Different from meta-learning-based approaches, it learns sample-specific feature separation policies, not just client-level model parameters. This strategy allows effective sharing of globally useful information while maintaining personalization."
