        "abstract": "This paper proposes DCdetector, a dual attention contrastive learning framework for time series anomaly detection. The approach focuses on learning contrastive representations that help distinguish anomalies from normal patterns without the need for heavy supervision. The DCdetector architecture leverages dual attention mechanisms to enhance the discriminative power of learned representations, enabling effective anomaly detection across various real-world datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DCdetector against state-of-the-art baselines.",
