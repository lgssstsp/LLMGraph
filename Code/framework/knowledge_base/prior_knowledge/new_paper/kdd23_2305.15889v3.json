        "abstract": "In this work, we comprehensively consider the role of domain labels in the domain generalization (DG) task and propose a heterogeneity-based two-stage contrastive learning (HTCL) framework. The proposed method attempts to tackle the challenges associated with domain heterogeneity. By introducing a novel learning potential-guided heterogeneity metric and employing contrastive learning, HTCL can effectively improve the performance of models on unseen domains. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method across various DG datasets.",
