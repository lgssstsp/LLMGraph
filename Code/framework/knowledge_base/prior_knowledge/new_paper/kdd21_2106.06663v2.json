We propose a novel attack framework, Topological Defective Graph Injection Attack (TDGIA), which involves injecting nodes into the graph to leverage topological vulnerabilities in GNNs. Our approach optimizes the injected nodes' connections and features to maximize prediction errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method against various defense models.",
