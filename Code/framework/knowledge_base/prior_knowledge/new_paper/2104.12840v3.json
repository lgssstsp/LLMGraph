This paper proposes AdaGNN, a novel graph neural network with an adaptive frequency response filter that adjusts the importance of different frequency components in the spectral domain. By addressing the limitations of fixed low-pass filters in existing GNNs, AdaGNN achieves better node representation learning and alleviates the over-smoothing problem by preserving useful high-frequency information.",
