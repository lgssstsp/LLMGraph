        "abstract": "This paper introduces JERS, an end-to-end framework for joint brain extraction, registration, and segmentation. It addresses challenges in performing these tasks without individual task labels by using a single labeled template. JERS integrates modules for each task, enabling joint learning and optimization. Extensive experiments on public brain MRI datasets demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "related papers": "Smith et al. introduced a deformable model for brain extraction. Other techniques utilize edge detection and filtering. The registration domain has seen both conventional techniques and deep learning methods like RegNet. In segmentation, CNN-based approaches dominate, although they often require a large dataset. Joint registration and segmentation efforts have shown promising improvements.",
