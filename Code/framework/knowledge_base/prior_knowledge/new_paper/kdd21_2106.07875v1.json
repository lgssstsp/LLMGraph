        "abstract": "This paper addresses the instability issues found in post hoc explanation models like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). Despite their popularity, these models often yield inconsistent results due to the randomness in perturbation sampling. Our primary contribution is the development of S-LIME, a variant that employs a hypothesis testing approach to derive a stable number of perturbations necessary for consistent explanations. Our findings highlight the necessity of stability in enhancing user trust, understanding complex models, and preventing potential misuse in critical applications such as healthcare and criminal justice.",
