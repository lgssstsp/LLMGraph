        "abstract": "This paper introduces Spatio-temporal Diffusion Point Processes (DSTPP), a novel framework for effectively learning spatio-temporal joint distributions without requiring independence assumptions or Monte Carlo sampling. The method excels at addressing structural limitations present in existing frameworks by employing a diffusion model paradigm that allows for easy training and closed-form sampling. Experimental results across diverse datasets showcase DSTPP's superior performance over state-of-the-art Spatio-temporal Point Process (STPP) models.",
