        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often alternate between transforming node features and pooling, which reduces node count to create coarsened graph representations. This research presents a modular framework for graph pooling, introducing three functions: selection, reduction, and connection (SRC). Our comprehensive taxonomy identifies four properties characterizing pooling operators, some mapping node features into fewer nodes, retaining essential graph information through learnable operators like DiffPool and MinCut. Experimentation is focused on evaluating whether pooling operators preserve graph attributes and information structure, offering guidelines for optimal pooling method choices in different scenarios.",
