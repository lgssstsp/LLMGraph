However, real-world graph structures are often noisy and incomplete, challenging the robustness of GNNs. Graph Structure Learning (GSL) aims to enhance graph resilience by optimizing the graph topology. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages structural entropy and encoding tree theory for superior task-relevant graph topology optimization.",
