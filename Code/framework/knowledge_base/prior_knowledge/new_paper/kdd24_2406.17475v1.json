This study focuses on mitigating popularity bias, which causes disproportionate exposure for popular items at the expense of less popular ones. We propose a re-ranking strategy using strategic learning agents executed by producers to enhance the visibility and utility of tail items, ensuring both fairness and accuracy of recommendations.",
