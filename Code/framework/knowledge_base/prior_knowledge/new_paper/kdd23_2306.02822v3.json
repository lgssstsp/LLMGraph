        "abstract": "This paper tackles the critical problem of learning a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure from observational data, pivotal for numerous fields such as genetics, biology, economics, and social sciences. While traditional score-based methods pose DAG learning as a combinatorial optimization problem, their performance is hindered by the lack of integration between the data fitting process and graph structure. We propose CASPER, a dynamic approach that redefines the score function by incorporating DAG-ness awareness. The integration allows for adaptive optimization of causal graphs even in noisy environments, cutting across barriers in complex real-world applications. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements with CASPER over previous methods, highlighting it as a potential path towards robust and precise causal discovery.",

Despite advances, existing methods often fall short in handling complex, noisy datasets. Hence, we propose CASPER, dynamically adapting causal graphs to better address these challenges.",
