        "abstract": "This paper proposes Geometric Mixup, a method leveraging geometry information for Mixup by interpolating features and labels with those from nearby neighborhood. We provide theoretic insights into our approach for utilizing graph structure and emphasizing the importance of enhancing locality information, a critical design aspect enabling our method to accommodate to both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Additionally, we extend our strategy to facilitate all-pair Mixup and dynamically learn the mixing weights, overcoming the challenges posed by noise in the given graph structure. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Geometric Mixup substantially improves the performance of underlying GNNs on both standard datasets and OOD generalization tasks.",
