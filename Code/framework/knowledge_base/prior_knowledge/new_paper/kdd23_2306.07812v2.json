        "abstract": "In the domain of molecular science, the prediction of molecular properties is pivotal for drug discovery and materials science. Traditional methods rely on Density Functional Theory (DFT), which is both computationally intensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, machine learning methods, especially those employing graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph transformers, have proven effective. Recent advancements have focused on integrating 3D structural data into models, improving accuracy. However, 3D data is often unavailable or expensive to compute. This paper proposes 3D PGT, a novel approach that leverages pre-trained transformers on 3D molecular datasets but is fine-tuned and predicted using only 2D molecular graphs. 3D PGT achieves a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency, surpassing existing baselines.",
