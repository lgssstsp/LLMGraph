Their intricate hierarchical, geometric, and topological relationships necessitate advanced representation learning techniques that can capture these properties. This research presents a novel approach called Geometric Tree Message Passing (GTMP) and complements it with a self-supervised learning framework, namely Geometric Tree Self-Supervised Learning (GT-SSL), to effectively learn geometric tree representations.",
