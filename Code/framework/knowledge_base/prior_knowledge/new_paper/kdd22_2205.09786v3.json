        "abstract": "In the vast expanse of dynamic networks where entities continuously interact, identifying significant shifts in individual contexts becomes paramount. Yet, as graph size and data streams grow, traditional methods falter, either focusing on graph-level changes or failing to capture node-level nuances. Enter DynAnom, our proposed framework leveraging a generalization of local node representation combined with efficient anomaly tracking mechanisms. Specifically, we extend dynamic forward push algorithms to work seamlessly on weighted graphs. This paves the way for real-time anomaly detection, localizing subtle yet critical shifts in node contexts. Through extensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets, DynAnom consistently outranks its predecessors in both accuracy and processing speed, heralding a new era in dynamic graph anomaly tracking.",
