        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can easily fool the network into misclassification by altering the graph structure or node features. This paper presents a defense model named STABLE, which aims to strengthen GNNs' robustness by refining graph structures using unsupervised representation learning. The STABLE model consists of two parts: a structure learning network that captures robust representations and adjusts the graph structure appropriately, followed by an advanced GCN that enhances performance resilience. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STABLE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods against various adversarial attacks.",
