        "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unsupervised graph representation learning. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating high-quality positive pairs while neglecting efficient negative sample generation, leading to a potential deficiency in learning robustness. In this work, we propose a counterfactual-inspired generative model that addresses the challenge of hard negative sampling in GCL. Our method introduces constraints and a sophisticated similarity-aware loss function to ensure the quality and hardness of the negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.",
