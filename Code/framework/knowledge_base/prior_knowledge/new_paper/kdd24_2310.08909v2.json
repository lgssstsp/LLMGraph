        "abstract": "In interconnected entities such as social networks, identifying communities is vital for understanding complex graph structures. Community detection algorithms group nodes based on shared characteristics, shedding light on network organization and dynamics. This study explores 'community membership hiding,' allowing users to preserve privacy while remaining on platforms. Drawing from counterfactual reasoning, we use a Markov decision process and deep reinforcement learning framework to guide nodes in avoiding community detection. Extensive experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing baselines, offering a balance between privacy and usability.",
