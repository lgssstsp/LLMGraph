        "abstract": "This paper investigates the fundamental elements within transformer networks by formalizing the Information Pathways hypothesis. The study uncovers sparsely connected subnetworks within transformers, which are termed Information Pathways. These pathways can be independently stimulated across training episodes to reduce overhead and enhance generalization. A methodology termed Stochastically Subsampled self-Attention (SSA) is introduced to efficiently selectively sample crucial pathways, thus alleviating training costs considerably. The paper elucidates the efficacy of SSA across various domains like natural language processing, image classification, and graph regression, extending applications to any tasks harnessing dense self-attention models.",
