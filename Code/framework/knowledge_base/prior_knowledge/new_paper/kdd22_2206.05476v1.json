The task is crucial for optimizing database tasks and has applications in network security, data compression, and ecological studies. We propose a novel approach that adapts classical sampling-based methods for distributed settings, allowing the estimation with sub-linear communication costs. The approach utilizes sketch-based algorithms to minimize data transfer without sacrificing accuracy, providing theoretical and experimental analyses to validate its efficacy.",
