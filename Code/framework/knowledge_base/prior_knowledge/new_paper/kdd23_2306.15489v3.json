        "abstract": "Anomaly detection is pivotal across numerous applications, notably in finance, cyber security, and medical care. With the criticality of time series data in these domains, this paper introduces a novel framework, termed PAD (Precursor of Anomaly Detection), utilizing neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). Our approach tackles multivariate and irregular time series and is pioneering in detecting precursors of anomalies over generalized domains. By harnessing a multi-task learning strategy combined with knowledge distillation, PAD offers unparalleled accuracy in both current anomaly and precursor-of-anomaly detection tasks. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates superior performance over 17 baseline models, underscoring PAD's potential as an innovative solution.",
