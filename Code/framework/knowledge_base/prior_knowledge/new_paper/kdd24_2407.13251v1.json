Our approach introduces the concept of motif-consistent counterfactual data generation combined with adversarial refinement to address traditional challenges in graph data. We employ a graph producer and a GAN-based optimizer to generate high-quality counterfactual graphs that enhance model generalization across varying environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets.",
