        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel unified end-to-end framework, called ERNet, for unsupervised collective extraction and registration. Unlike previous works that separate these tasks, our method captures the interdependencies between brain extraction and image registration in a holistic manner. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.",
