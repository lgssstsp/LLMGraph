        "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in ranking systems, especially under the complexity of diverse user behavior. Existing estimators often falter as they rely on universal assumptions about user interactions, which do not hold across diverse populations. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive IPS (AIPS) estimator, which operates based on a novel context-aware formulation, minimizing variance while maintaining unbiased estimates. AIPS is shown to achieve superior mean squared error (MSE) performance over traditional techniques in both synthetic and real-world data evaluations.",

        "comparisons with related methods": "Compared to traditional methods such as IPS and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators, AIPS incorporates a context-aware strategy, allowing it to adaptively weigh the relevance of actions, thereby achieving a lower variance and unbiasedness across diverse user scenarios. Its superiority is observed even against advanced methods like Cascade-DR, particularly in large action spaces."

        "summary of this paper": "The paper proposes a new estimator, Adaptive IPS (AIPS), for off-policy evaluation in ranking systems where user behavior is diverse and context-dependent. Unlike traditional estimators that apply a single assumption uniformly, AIPS adapts based on user context, capturing the heterogeneity in user behavior to provide accurate estimation.",
        "research purpose": "To develop a more suitable OPE estimator that accounts for diverse user behavior in ranking systems, reducing bias and variance while maintaining accuracy in evaluating new policies.",
        "research challenge": "Existing OPE methods often apply a single universal assumption about user behavior, which introduces significant bias and variance when user interactions are diverse.",
        "method summary": "The proposed AIPS estimator uses adaptive importance weighting, leveraging a context-dependent formulation to adaptively apply different importance weights to different scenarios.",
        "conclusion": "AIPS is an unbiased estimator that minimizes variance among IPS-based estimators. It enhances OPE accuracy through adaptive user behavior modeling, showing significant improvement over existing methods in both synthetic and real-world experiments."
