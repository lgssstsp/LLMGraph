        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network, named Frigate, designed to predict network-constrained time-series processes on road networks. Frigate stands apart by its ability to model large-scale networks frugally with limited sensing while ensuring robustness against temporal granularity irregularity and network topology changes. It incorporates innovative design elements such as Lipschitz positional embeddings, direction-based message aggregation, gating for deep network capability, and utilization of statistical moments to enhance prediction accuracy. Our model demonstrates superior performance over baseline methods, particularly in high-traffic nodes, using a fraction of the data required by other models.",
