However, annotating attributes for large-scale data is challenging. Multimodal knowledge, such as concept words and images, can improve cognitive abilities in ZSL, but challenges remain, including organizing multimodal data and capturing semantic associations. This paper presents a Fine-grained Graph Propagation (FGP) model, utilizing a semantic space and visual knowledge learning to enhance ZSL through multimodal data. Evaluation on large datasets demonstrates the model's efficiency.",
