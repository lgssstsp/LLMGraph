The formulations extend existing dense subgraph problems while incorporating diversity attributes for nodes, catering to the increasing necessity for fairness and representation in network analysis. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets reveal significant improvements over prior methods in obtaining diverse and dense subgraphs.",
