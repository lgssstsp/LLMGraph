        "abstract": "In this work, we propose LoGoNet, a novel architecture that seamlessly combines global and local attention mechanisms for efficient 3D medical image segmentation. Through a unique dual encoding strategy, LoGoNet maintains high precision while achieving reduced inference time. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised pre-training method that leverages unlabeled data to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. By incorporating a large-kernel attention model into a U-shaped architecture, LoGoNet demonstrates significant improvements in resource efficiency and segmentation performance across diverse medical imaging tasks. Experimental evaluations on the BTCV and MSD datasets reveal that LoGoNet surpasses baseline models both in segmentation accuracy and computational costs.",
