        "abstract": "Image similarity has been a critical concept in computer vision for decades. Recent advances in deep learning offer new potentials for estimating image similarity, often leveraged in content-based retrieval. Despite these advancements, aligning these embeddings with human perception still poses challenges. This paper re-examines the fundamental problem of image similarity with a novel dataset of 30k labeled triples. Through the methods of context-sensitive training and ensemble modeling, we present a systematic approach to improving model competency across varied contexts. Our experimental findings highlight the potential of this method in achieving superior semantic alignment over conventional approaches.",
