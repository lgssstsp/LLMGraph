        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for unsupervised text style transfer called Manipulating Sequential Style Representation Network (MSSRNet). By integrating a teacher-student learning strategy within an adversarial training framework, MSSRNet enables precise control over the style strength of each token within a text, allowing for enhanced content preservation and effective style manipulation. Extensive experiments show that MSSRNet outperforms existing methods in both two-style and multi-style setups, achieving higher style transfer accuracy and content consistency.",
