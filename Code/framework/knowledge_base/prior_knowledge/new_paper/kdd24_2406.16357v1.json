        "abstract": "Graph data is ubiquitous in various domains, including social networks, protein interactions, and transportation networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model these graphs for tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, designing effective GNNs manually can be laborious, leading to the development of Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) for automated design. Lightweight GNAS further reduces computational demands, making it suitable for more applications. This paper introduces GASSIP, a novel approach that iteratively optimizes graph data and architectures through curriculum graph sparsification and operation pruning, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of lightweight GNNs.",
