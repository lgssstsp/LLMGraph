This paper introduces a new initialization method using Laplacian Eigenmaps with a popularity-based regularization to improve the embedding initialization for neural recommenders. The method exploits neighborhood structures and addresses challenges posed by sparse data using popularity-based adjustments for isolated data points. We demonstrate the effectiveness on multiple datasets, showing substantial gain in performance over existing methods.",
