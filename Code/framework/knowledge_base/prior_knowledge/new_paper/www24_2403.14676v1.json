        "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis is the process of assessing examinees' cognitive states based on their activities. Despite advancements, uncertainty in diagnosis, particularly using existing models like IRT and Bayesian methods, limits its reliability and application in educational settings. This paper proposes a new approach: UCD (Uncertainty estimation for Cognitive Diagnosis models) offering a unified framework adaptable to both traditional and deep learning models. Empirical experiments corroborate the method's effectiveness, offering deeper insights into inherent uncertainties.",
