        "abstract": "With the proliferation of IoT devices, smart home environments face significant security threats due to abnormal behaviors. SmartGuard proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for user behavior in smart homes. It addresses challenges such as user behavior imbalance, contextual dependence, and noise in behavior sequences using three novel strategies: Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy (LDMS), Three-level Time-aware Position Embedding (TTPE), and Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss (NWRL). Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate its superior efficacy and interpretability over state-of-the-art methods.",
