        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been substantially explored for node representation learning in graphs. Recent literature suggests that GNNs perform well on homophilous graphs but generally fail on graphs with heterophily. In this study, we challenge this assumption by investigating the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) performance across the homophily-heterophily spectrum. Our findings reveal that GCNs can perform well on heterophilous graphs when same-label nodes share similar neighborhood patterns. We provide a theoretical understanding of the conditions under which GCNs thrive, supported by empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our research calls for rethinking the perceived necessity of strong homophily for effective GNN performance.",

        "related papers": "Several works have examined GNN performance in varying graph types, emphasizing architectural modifications to handle heterophily. Notable contributions include Geom-GCN (Pei et al., 2020), H2GCN (Zhu et al., 2020), GPR-GNN (Chien et al., 2021), and CPGNN (Zhu et al., 2020). Some research explores breaking homophilous assumptions (Suresh et al., 2021) and concurrent studies suggest GCN's proficiency in dealing with heterophilous graphs (Luan et al., 2021).",
        "comparisons with related methods": "Our work diverges by not proposing a new model but providing evidence and theoretical insight into GCN's capabilities under heterophilous conditions. Unlike architectural modifications such as in H2GCN and CPGNN, we focus on understanding inherent GCN properties directly related to induction bias across graph types."
