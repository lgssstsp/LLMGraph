        "abstract": "The integration of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PVs) into Power Distribution Networks (PDNs) has prompted significant interest in developing solutions for Active Voltage Control (AVC) to maintain voltage stability amid fluctuating generation conditions. Recent trends focus on methods involving deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address the real-time voltage regulation challenge in large-scale networks. However, these approaches often focus on short-term tactics, neglecting various temporal distribution shifts that occur over longer durations. This paper introduces the Temporal Prototype-Aware Learning (TPA) method that tackles these challenges, allowing agents to adapt to multi-scale temporal variations in PDNs by leveraging temporal prototypes as representative temporal patterns for enhancing decision-making in Active Voltage Control. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art MARL-based solutions, especially in long-term continuous operation cycles, making it a promising candidate for time-adaptive AVC strategy development.",
