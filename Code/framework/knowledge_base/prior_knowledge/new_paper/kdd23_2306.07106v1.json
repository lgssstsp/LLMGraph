        "abstract": "Online advertising relies heavily on real-time bidding (RTB), which optimizes advertisers' bidding strategies to fulfill diverse constraints. However, most approaches assume i.i.d. bidding environments, which seldom occur in adversarial real-world scenarios where sellers and competitors aim to maximize conflicting objectives. This paper explores adversarial constrained bidding by proposing a Minimax Regret Optimization (MiRO) framework, enabling robust strategies even when dynamics deviate from ideal conditions. By leveraging a causality-aware approach, we align policies with expert behaviors to prevent bias stemming from unobserved confounders. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of MiROCL, outperforming baseline methods on both industrial and synthetic datasets.",

        "comparisons with related methods": "The MiRO framework extends the concept of adversarial learning into the realm of constrained bidding, which traditionally focuses on i.i.d. settings. Previous works like USCB and CBRL leverage reinforcement learning under comfortable assumptions of independent environments, but MiRO enhances generalization by preparing for worst-case scenarios. It combines robustness from offline learning and the Minimax principle from game theory, unlike earlier methods that don't integrate adversarial resistance."
