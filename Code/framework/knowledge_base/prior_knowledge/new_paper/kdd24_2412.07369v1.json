        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach, ITPNet,for instantaneous trajectory prediction with very limited observed locations. ITPNet predicts the latent feature representations of unobserved locations backwardly to mitigate information lack issues. The proposed Noise Redundancy Reduction Former (NRRFormer) filters noise and redundancy in feature representations, effectively integrating them with observed features for future trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the compatibility and effectiveness of ITPNet across trajectory prediction models.",
