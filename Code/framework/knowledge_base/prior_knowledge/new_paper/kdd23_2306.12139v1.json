        "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various urban applications due to their capability to model complex relational data. However, most GNN approaches rely upon an implicit homophily assumption that closely connected nodes share similar features or labels, while ignoring heterophilic nodes with adverse ties. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a Spatial Heterophily-aware Graph Neural Network (SHGNN) that accounts for the distinctive heterogeneous structure in urban graphs. SHGNN introduces the concepts of spatial diversity scores and spatial heterophily to explore diverse dissimilarity distributions across urban environments, illustrating how nodes within different spatial arrangements affect model efficacy. The proposed SHGNN leverages the spatial characteristics of urban graphs by decomposing neighborhoods into finer partitions based on direction and distance settings. It also incorporates rotation-scaling based multi-head attention to capture intricate relational patterns reflecting the spatial heterophily trend identified in urban graphs. Extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets demonstrate that SHGNN significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art heterophilic GNN models in urban-specific tasks.",

(2021), Song et al. (2020), and Fang et al. (2021) utilizing GCNs and GATs. However, these suffer from limitations in capturing urban graph heterophily, motivating novel methodologies as explored by Pei et al. (2019) and Zhu et al. (2020) which probe different approaches to high-order aggregation and graph kernel transformations.",
        "comparisons with related methods": "Existing GNN methods primarily depend on the assumption of feature homophily, limiting the utility when faced with pronounced spatial heterophily as seen in urban contexts. While recent advancements, such as Mixhop and FAGCN, propose GNN extensions for heterophilic graphs, they largely overlook the spatial, directional, and distance diversity elements, limiting their effectiveness on nuanced urban datasets where SHGNN offers substantial improvement."
