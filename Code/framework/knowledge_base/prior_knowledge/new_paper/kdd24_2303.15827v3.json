        "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of mechanistic knowledge, particularly through Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), with data-driven machine learning methods has become increasingly relevant. We propose a new hybrid modeling approach that leverages both the vast amounts of available data and the underlying physics derived from PDEs to provide predictive insights and understanding of complex systems. Our method estimates unknown PDE coefficient functions by exploiting the structure of known PDE forms, enriched by the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. We specifically design our approach to offer competent predictions across a diverse range of systems, from classic models with constant coefficients to nonlinear equations such as the Navier-Stokes laws. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our solution performs robustly, even under conditions that involve out-of-distribution data, overcoming traditional challenges in extrapolative prediction and achieving a balance between explainability and accuracy. The results suggest a promising pathway towards advanced predictive modeling in fields including fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics.",
