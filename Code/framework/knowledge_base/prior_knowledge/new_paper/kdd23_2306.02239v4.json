        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a list-wise recommendation method that uses a generative flow network to represent the probabilistic list generation process. The resulting method, GFN4Rec, can generate high-quality recommendations with better diversity, which is well suited for online learning environments that require exploratory guidance. One key insight of the proposed method is a generative approach that directly matches the generation probability rather than the log probability with the list-wise reward. Another feature of GFN4Rec is the iterative item generation model that captures the item's mutual information and optimizes a future list reward. This notion may also suit other scenarios where intermediate rewards are not observed until the final object is generated (e.g., multi-stage recommendation). However, we remind readers that GFN4Rec requires more hyperparameters (reward smoothing, normalizing coefficient, and forward probability offset), which may take empirical efforts to find a feasible optimization setting than standard supervised learning. Additionally, GFN4Rec controls the balance between recommendation quality and diversity during online exploration, and the effectiveness of the exploration depends on the validity of this trade-off.",
