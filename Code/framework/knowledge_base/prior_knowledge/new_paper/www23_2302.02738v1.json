The model can estimate values for unobserved locations using data from observed locations by modeling heterogeneous spatial relations and diverse temporal patterns jointly. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating INCREASE outperforming state-of-the-art methods with significant margins, particularly under sparse data conditions. Future work will explore incorporating additional relations to further enhance performance.",
