This new paradigm addresses challenges in computational complexity and diverse global structures essential to graph-level tasks by developing a framework that consolidates clustering and pattern-matching modules. The proposed framework not only achieves high prediction accuracy but also reliably uncovers global interaction patterns, enhancing the depth of attribution analysis across multiple datasets.",
