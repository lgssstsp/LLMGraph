        "abstract": "This paper introduces a recommender system framework that prioritizes user knowledge expansion. Unlike traditional systems that prioritize engagement through relevance, this framework uses a user-behavior model to balance relevance and diversity. This model views the recommendation process as a continuous knowledge-exploration task. The proposed strategy outperforms existing models by maximizing knowledge accrued during exploration.",
