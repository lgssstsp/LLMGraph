        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in tasks like graph classification, but face challenges with shortcut biases during out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We propose the Causal Attention Learning (CAL) strategy, which mitigates the confounding effects of shortcut features that commonly leak into models during training. Through a novel causal intervention technique and disentanglement strategy, CAL differentiates causal features from trivial ones, significantly boosting generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAL's effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets.",
