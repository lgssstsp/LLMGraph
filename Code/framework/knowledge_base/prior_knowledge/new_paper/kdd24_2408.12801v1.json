        "abstract": "The rapidly increasing connectivity and sensor integration in modern environments generates vast amounts of multivariate time series data. Yet, time delays in data acquisition protocols often hamper real-time predictive tasks across various applications. Most existing time delay estimation methods assume deterministic delays, which rarely hold true in complex dynamic systems. This paper presents the Time Series Model Bootstrap (TSMB), a novel framework that mitigates the impact of stochastic time delays on predictive modeling, applicable to any black-box machine learning model.",

It introduces TSMB, a method to boost the accuracy of predictive models by accounting for uncertain time delays. Through extensive experimentation on real-world datasets, TSMB showcases enhanced performance over traditional methods in scenarios with varying delay types.",
