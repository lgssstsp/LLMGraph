This paper explores methods to calibrate predictive uncertainty in text classification tasks using evidential neural networks (ENNs). We propose a framework combining auxiliary datasets and off-manifold adversarial examples to enhance the model's OOD detection capabilities. Empirical studies demonstrate the promise of evidential uncertainty, as our approach significantly surpasses conventional methods.",
