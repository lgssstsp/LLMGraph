        "abstract": "This paper presents GCOPE, a novel framework designed for multi-domain graph pretraining by unifying diverse graph structures. GCOPE leverages virtual 'coordinator' nodes to bridge disconnected graph datasets, coordinating structural and semantic features for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic datasets revealed the framework's superiority in addressing negative transfer challenges, thus promoting efficient cross-domain knowledge sharing. GCOPE simplifies the training process and facilitates seamless integration of multi-domain knowledge across distinct graph datasets.",
