        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel computational framework called Sociologically-Informed Neural Network (SINN) to model and predict opinion dynamics in social networks. Our approach integrates the interpretability of sociological and psychological theories with the data-driven capabilities of neural networks. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that SINN outperforms traditional and contemporary predictive models, making it ideal for applications in social media analytics and marketing strategies. The model bridges the gap between established theoretical knowledge and modern data science approaches, offering both depth and flexibility in understanding the evolution of social opinions.",
