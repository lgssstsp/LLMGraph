        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a targeted universal attack (TUA) on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). The TUA is a specialized universal adversarial attack that aims to induce GCNs to misclassify any node into a predetermined class. This is achieved by strategically connecting 'fake' nodes to a select few nodes in the network, enhancing their adversarial capabilities. Using popular datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully attack GCNs with high efficacy, pointing to potential vulnerabilities in these models.",
