However, the depth of these models, especially the Propagation Depth ($D_p$) and Transformation Depth ($D_t$), considerably influences their performance. This paper investigates the over-smoothing and model degradation issues associated with deep GNNs, presenting Adaptive Initial Residual (AIR) as a solution to ameliorate these challenges and enable deeper architectures.",
