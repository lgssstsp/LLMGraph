        "abstract": "This paper presents a defense strategy named Bilateral Dependency Optimization (BiDO) aimed at mitigating model-inversion attacks in deep neural networks. The BiDO framework leverages statistical dependency measures, such as constrained covariance and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion, to regulate information flow within neural models by minimizing the dependency between latent representations and input features to prevent privacy leakage while maximizing the predictive capability through dependent output representations. Experimental results on datasets like CelebA, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate significant reduction in privacy attacks with minimal classification accuracy drop.",
