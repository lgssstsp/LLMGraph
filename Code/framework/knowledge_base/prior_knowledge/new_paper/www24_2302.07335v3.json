        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose IntellectReq, an innovative model that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the EC-CDR framework for recommendation systems by reducing unnecessary parameter requests through edge-cloud communication. We introduce a Mis-Recommendation Detector (MRD) and a Distribution Mapper (DM) to quantify the data distribution shifts and improve the adaptability of edge models to real-time user behavior. IntellectReq achieves optimized communication through efficient resource utilization while maintaining high recommendation performance, enabling dynamic personalized updates without the need for re-training.",
