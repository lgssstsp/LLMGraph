Temporal networks are naturally dynamic, involving interactions over time. Temporal motifs capturing these interactions add significant depth to network analysis. We demonstrate the limitations of existing methods that focus on static network properties. We develop algorithms leveraging temporal information to efficiently identify dense subnetworks driven by temporal motifs.",
