        "abstract": "In this paper, we present novel algorithms for learning multi-action Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) in an online setting. Unlike traditional RMAB frameworks that restrict planners to binary actions, our approach provides a more versatile decision-making tool, accommodating a variety of actions to address real-world applications efficiently. Our algorithms extend existing binary-action methods and are adept at learning dynamic system behaviors alongside decision-making. We demonstrate our methods surpass traditional benchmarks in terms of convergence speed and accrued rewards, making a significant stride towards real-world RMAB applications.",
