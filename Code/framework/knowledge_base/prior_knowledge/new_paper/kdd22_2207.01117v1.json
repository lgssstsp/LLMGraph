The SRDML reconsider the feature weights in traditional linear multitask learning and generalize them into non-linear situations using saliency detection. Specifically, the task relation problem is recast as the similarity among saliency regions across tasks. The proposed method's theoretical analysis demonstrates equivalency in functions and how regularization reduces generalization error. Extensive experiments validate the model's efficiency and interpretability on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",
