        "abstract": "Spatial-temporal forecasting has multifaceted applications, prominently in traffic flow forecasting, which is crucial for efficient Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The complex and long-range spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic networks pose challenges in accurately predicting traffic flow. This paper introduces a novel model, Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Network (STGODE), designed to effectively capture these dependencies. STGODE incorporates graph neural networks, leveraging residual connections and continuous ODE frameworks to overcome the over-smoothing challenges in traditional GNNs, thereby enhancing spatial-temporal adjacency modeling through both geographical and semantic lenses. The study validates STGODE's supremacy over existing methodologies via comprehensive experiments on real-world traffic datasets.",
