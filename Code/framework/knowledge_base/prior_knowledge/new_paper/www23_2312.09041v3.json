        "abstract": "This paper introduces a Diverse Spectral Filtering (DSF) framework aimed at enhancing the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to handle complex graphs characterized by regional heterogeneity. By moving beyond the conventional homogeneous spectral filtering, our DSF framework efficiently captures and exploits rich local graph variations. Theoretical and empirical validations demonstrate the efficacy and improved interpretability of GNNs under the DSF framework.",

        "related papers": "Graphs with diverse topologies or heterogeneity have often been downplayed in spectral GNNs. Prior works (e.g., GPR-GNN, BernNet, JacobiConv) have showcased polynomial spectral filtering approaches, primarily favoring homogeneous filtering strategies. In contrast, recent discussions on network heterogeneity (e.g., heterophily) highlight challenges traditional models face in adapting to these settings.",
        "comparisons with related methods": "Most existing spectral methods employ uniform polynomial spectral filters, assuming invariant graph patterns across regions—an approach that may limit their adaptability to varying graph disparities. DSF, however, introduces spatial variance awareness within filters, allowing for better regional context modeling."

This framework endorses both local and global graph insights, optimizing graph learning by differentiating node-level filter coefficients. The novel model architecture enhances node classification tasks across heterogeneous graphs.",

        "method summary": "The DSF framework adapts spectral GNN models by locally adjusting node-specific filters in consideration of their positional context. The model utilizes iterative embedding techniques and polynomial decomposition to achieve diversity in filters, reducing overfitting and noise sensitivity.",
