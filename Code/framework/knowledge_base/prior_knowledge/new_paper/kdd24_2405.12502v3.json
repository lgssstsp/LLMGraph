        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of training unsupervised outlier detection (UOD) models on contaminated datasets. Traditional approaches often struggle to mitigate the adverse effects of anomalies on training. Our solution, EntropyStop, leverages data distribution analysis via loss entropy to improve training performance and efficiency. Loss entropy acts as an internal evaluation metric reflecting changes in the model's detection capability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate EntropyStop's effectiveness in enhancing model robustness and reducing training time across various models and datasets.",
