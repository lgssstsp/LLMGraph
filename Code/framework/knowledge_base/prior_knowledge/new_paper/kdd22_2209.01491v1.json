        "abstract": "The development of effective models for time series data such as physiologic signals, financial markets, and traffic flows holds significant utility across various domains. While deep learning models have marked improvements in forecasting accuracy, they are often criticized for lack of interpretability. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging neural differential equations to learn partial differential equations (PDEs) for interpretable time series modeling. The key architecture, $P$-block, successfully captures multivariate dynamics and facilitates the learning of polynomials over target variables and derivatives. Additionally, the hybrid PDE model with meta-learning allows adaptive responses to dynamics, enhancing performance and interpretability.",
