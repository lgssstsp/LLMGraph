        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-source spatial point data prediction. The framework leverages disparate data sources to create a model capable of accurate predictions even in the absence of consistent ground truth. Our approach introduces a self-supervised strategy that is pivotal for aligning various datasets through mutual information maximization. Additionally, we introduce the concept of fidelity scores to dynamically assess and utilize the quality of each data source. A unique geo-location-aware graph neural network is developed to manage the complexities of spatial relationships effectively. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods in various real-world and synthetic datasets.",
