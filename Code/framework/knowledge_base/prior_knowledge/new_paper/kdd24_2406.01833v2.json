        "abstract": "We present CAFO, a novel feature-centric explanation framework for multivariate time series (MTS) classification. Our approach utilizes Channel Attention (CA) and Feature Orthogonalization for achieving efficient and interpretable classification. We introduce Channel Attention and Feature Orthogonalization (CAFO) to improve the semantic interpretability of MTS models, addressing a critical gap in the explainability of multivariate data. We propose a new convolution-based framework called DepCA and a QR decomposition-based regularizer named QR-Ortho. These methods provide feature-centric explanations, cutting unnecessary computational and manufacturing costs in industries requiring MTS applications. Extensive experiments validate our methodologies against other explainable approaches.",
