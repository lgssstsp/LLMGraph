This paper introduces a novel Unified and Robust Representation Learning framework for IMVC (URRL-IMVC), avoiding cross-view contrastive learning and missing view recovery. The proposed attention-based auto-encoder network fuses multi-view information into a unified embedding, enhancing robustness against missing views by integrating KNN imputation and data augmentation.",
