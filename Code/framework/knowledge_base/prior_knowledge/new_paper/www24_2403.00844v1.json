        "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to address the challenge of information overload on the web by recommending the Top-K most relevant items to users. These systems often rely on optimization metrics that focus on item ranking, such as NDCG@K and Recall@K, which are computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, 'Lower-Left Partial AUC' (LLPAUC), designed to be more aligned with Top-K ranking. LLPAUC focuses on the lower-left corner of the ROC curve, emphasizing the ranking of top items and promising better correlation with Top-K metrics. Our theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate LLPAUC's efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness across various datasets and conditions.",
