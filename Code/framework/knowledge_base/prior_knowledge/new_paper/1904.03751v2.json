        "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained significant traction due to their ability to process non-Euclidean data. However, training deep GCN architectures remains challenging due to issues like vanishing gradients and over-smoothing. In this paper, we extend techniques successful in deep CNNs, such as residual and dense connections, to GCNs. Our approach significantly improves GCN depth and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in point cloud semantic segmentation. We also conduct extensive experiments to understand these adaptations, establishing the foundation for more effective GCN training.",
