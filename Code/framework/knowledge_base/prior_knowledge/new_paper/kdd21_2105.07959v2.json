        "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of choice set confounding on discrete choice modeling and proposes methods to mitigate its effects using causal inference techniques. We identify issues in traditional models, such as the choice set confounding caused by chooser-dependent selection mechanisms, which challenge the validity of predictions on counterfactuals. The paper adapts inverse probability weighting and regression controls to address these challenges, simultaneously illustrating how clustering methods can be leveraged for known choosers without specific covariates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed methods' efficacy in reducing confounding impacts and enhancing model predictive accuracy.",
