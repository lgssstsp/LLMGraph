        "abstract": "Recommender systems have evolved significantly with the integration of advanced techniques such as deep learning and graph neural networks (GNNs). Recent developments have focused on incorporating diverse data modalities to enhance traditional recommenders, with a particular interest in large language models (LLMs). Despite their potential, LLM-based systems encounter challenges such as scalability and reliance on textual data alone, which may introduce performance issues related to hallucination and data noise. We propose \\model, a model-agnostic framework that bridges the gap between ID-based systems and LLMs through representation learning, effectively aligning the semantic space of LLMs with collaborative relational signals. Our framework integrates textual signals to enhance recommendations by leveraging mutual information maximization to align representations from both modalities. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the ability of \\model\\ to enhance recommendation performance and robustness against noisy data, while maintaining efficient training times.",

Techniques like NGCF~\\cite{wang2019neural} and LightGCN~\\cite{he2020lightgcn} focus on modeling these connections. The incorporation of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4~\\cite{openai2023gpt4} has introduced novel avenues by integrating textual data. Efforts such as InstructRec~\\cite{zhang2023recommendation} aim at aligning recommendation tasks with language model capabilities.",
