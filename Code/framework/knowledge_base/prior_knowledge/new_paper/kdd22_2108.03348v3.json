        "abstract": "Graph-structured data is pervasive in various domains including molecular chemistry and social networking. Due to the complex interconnectivity of nodes, graph data processing remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel adaptation of the transformer architecture, called edge channels, enhancing transformers to directly process graph structures effectively. The framework addresses both node and edge prediction tasks, outperforming existing Graph Neural Networks in experiments.",
