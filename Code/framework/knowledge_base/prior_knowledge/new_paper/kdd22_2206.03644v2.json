        "abstract": "Contextual bandits, a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, have found extensive applications in recommendation systems, clinical trials, and more. However, existing approaches often rely on parametric reward assumptions and overlook correlations among arm groups. This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach, AGG (Arm Group Graph), to contextual bandits, leveraging group information without parametric constraints. Utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), our proposed framework collaborates across similar arm groups, enhancing the reward estimation process. Theoretical analysis confirms near-optimal regret bounds, and experiments demonstrate superior performance on real-world datasets.",
