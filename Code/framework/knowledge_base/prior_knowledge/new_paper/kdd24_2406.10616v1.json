        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative approach by enabling multiple parties to contribute to a shared machine learning model without the need for direct data exchange. Along this line, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has been proposed to collaboratively train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to extract distributed knowledge from interconnected subgraphs held privately by each party. Existing FGL approaches predominantly involve two paradigms: cross-silo FGL and cross-device FGL. However, these paradigms struggle to handle the complexities of mixed cross-silo cross-device environments. We propose a unified cross-silo cross-device framework, HiFGL, for multi-level privacy preservation without compromising graph information integrity. This research offers a flexible and efficient solution for diverse real-world applications.",
