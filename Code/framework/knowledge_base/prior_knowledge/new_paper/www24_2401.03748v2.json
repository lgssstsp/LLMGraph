        "abstract": "In a federated recommendation system, preserving user privacy while maintaining communication efficiency poses significant challenges. We introduce a novel framework, \\arcronym, to enhance communication efficiency by implementing low-rank updates in federated learning. The key component, \\fullname, reduces both uplink and downlink communication costs while allowing compatibility with secure aggregation protocols. Extensive experiments demonstrate \\arcronym's ability to achieve competitive performance with significant reductions in communication cost compared to existing methods.",
