        "abstract": "This paper introduces FlexCare, a model adept at integrating incomplete multimodal electric health record (EHR) inputs for multiple predictive clinical tasks. FlexCare, unlike traditional models requiring full labels across tasks, employs asynchronous predictions across tasks, accommodating both input and label variability. Key contributions include the development of a task-agnostic multimodal extraction module and a task-guided fusion module ensuring comprehensive representation learning. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate FlexCare’s superior performance, highlighting the utility of inter-task synergy.",
