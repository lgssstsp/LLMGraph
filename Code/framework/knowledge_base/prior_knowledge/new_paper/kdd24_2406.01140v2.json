        "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are robust data structures representing real-world entities and their interrelations. Despite their utility, knowledge graphs often remain incomplete due to the challenges associated with manual data collection. This research paper discusses the development of a novel framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) named NORAN, which aims to address inductive Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). NORAN focuses on mining latent relation semantics to predict missing facts in evolving graphs, providing a promising solution to understand and integrate newly emerging entities. Extensive testing across multiple datasets demonstrates NORAN's effectiveness and superiority over existing methods.",
