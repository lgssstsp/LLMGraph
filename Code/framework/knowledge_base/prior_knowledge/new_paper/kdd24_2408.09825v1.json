        "abstract": "In this work, we propose an effective framework, TDNetGen, for complex network resilience prediction. It not only addresses the problem in a data-driven manner without prior knowledge about ground-truth dynamics but also solves the labeled data sparsity problem with the generative augmentation of jointly modeling network topology and dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TDNetGen and also highlight its robustness within less labeled data and dynamics information conditions. The methodology introduced in this paper provides a novel perspective for improving resilience prediction through data augmentation, leveraging the untapped potential of unlabeled data to enhance the learning process.",
