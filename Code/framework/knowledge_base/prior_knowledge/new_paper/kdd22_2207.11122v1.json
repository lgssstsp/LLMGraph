        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of containerized systems and Kubernetes-like architectures in cloud platforms has brought attention to the complex issue of container scheduling. This paper addresses this challenge by recasting the scheduling problem as a Stochastic Bin Packing Problem (SBPP), introducing the UCaC metric for optimization in both empty and nonempty machine scenarios. The proposed method focuses on optimizing CPU utilization while managing resource overcommitment, with algorithms both heuristic and exact. Evaluation on synthetic and real datasets confirms the effectiveness of the UCaC-based approach, demonstrating improvements over existing methods that solely optimize machine count.",
