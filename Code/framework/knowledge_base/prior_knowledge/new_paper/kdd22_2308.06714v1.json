        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of graph learning with out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes in the context of semi-supervised node classification. Leveraging GNNs as the core tool, we introduce OODGAT, a novel model designed to separate in-distribution nodes from OOD ones through an attention mechanism. Various settings including label noise, low labeling, and distribution shifts are considered, and a joint framework for simultaneous classification and OOD detection is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to existing methods.",
