        "abstract": "In the era of big data, the ability to accurately and efficiently process and analyze real-time data streams is crucial. However, data streams often contain sensitive information, necessitating privacy-preserving techniques. This research introduces \\textsc{DPSW-Sketch}, a framework that provides rigorous event-level differential privacy in processing frequency and heavy hitter queries over sliding windows. Introducing a novel sketch framework, \\textsc{DPSW-Sketch} ensures privacy while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency in stream analysis. Extensive experimental results confirm its effectiveness across various datasets and conditions, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.",
