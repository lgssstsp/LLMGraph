        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel framework for adversarial training specifically designed for spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models. Recognizing the limitations of static defense strategies in dynamic environments, the proposed method employs reinforcement learning to dynamically select adversarial samples, enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks with minimal overfitting. Furthermore, a self-knowledge distillation strategy addresses the 'forgetting issue' during training by transferring knowledge from previous epochs. Evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that this approach significantly boosts adversarial robustness, crucial for the effectiveness and reliability of Intelligent Transportation Systems.",
