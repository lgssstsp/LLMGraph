        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model while keeping client data private. However, FL faces challenges such as privacy, data heterogeneity, and communication costs. An often-overlooked issue is the label noise in client datasets, which can degrade model performance. This paper addresses the noisy label problem in FL by formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem. We propose two efficient algorithms for this problem, leveraging gradient compression to reduce communication costs. Empirical evaluations show our methods outperform other approaches in mitigating the effects of noisy labels.",

In contrast to other FL methods, such as FOCUS and Preprocess, which operate at the client level, Comm-FedBiO effectively identifies and mitigates the influence of noisy labels directly through federated bilevel optimization."
