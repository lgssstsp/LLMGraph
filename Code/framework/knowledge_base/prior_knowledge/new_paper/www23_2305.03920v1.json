Such diverse data drives the need for effective spatio-temporal prediction frameworks for various urban sensing applications. To tackle the challenges in urban sensing scenarios, we propose an Automated Spatio-Temporal graph contrastive learning paradigm to provide effective and robust region representations with multi-view spatio-temporal data in the urban sensing scenario.",
