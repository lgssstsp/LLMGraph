        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention due to their ability to extract knowledge from graph data, yet they remain opaque black-box models. Improving their interpretability, particularly under distribution shifting issues, is crucial for broader adoption. This paper introduces MixupExplainer, which extends the Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) framework by integrating a label-independent mixing approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method not only reduces distribution shifting but also improves explanation fidelity on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
