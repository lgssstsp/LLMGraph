        "abstract": "Missing data is a common challenge in detection systems, especially in high-resolution monitoring systems. Factors such as inclement weather, energy supply, and sensor service time can adversely affect the quality of monitoring data. Extensive research has contributed to data-driven methods for this purpose, especially in the field of spatiotemporal data. In this paper, we leverage the structural priors of low-rankness to generalize the canonical Transformer in general spatiotemporal imputation tasks.",
