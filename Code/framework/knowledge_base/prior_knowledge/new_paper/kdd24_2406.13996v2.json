We establish a theoretical framework revealing the equivalence between contrastive loss and graph convolutions, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling high-order connectivity (HOC) without requiring traditional graph convolutional layers. Our proposed Simple Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (SCCF) approach, reliant on a naive embedding model and a refined contrastive objective, surpasses conventional graph-based methods in CF tasks, challenging the necessity of convolutional layers.",
