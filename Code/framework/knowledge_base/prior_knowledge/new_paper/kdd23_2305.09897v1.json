        "abstract": "Partial label learning (PLL) is proposed to address the challenge of expensive and time-consuming acquisition of highly accurate labels in multi-class learning. In PLL, an instance is associated with a set of candidate labels instead of one exact label. This paper introduces a novel PLL method, PL-CL, which leverages complementary learning to enhance label disambiguation. By utilizing both candidate and non-candidate labels, along with an adaptive local graph, PL-CL enhances classification accuracy by facilitating a dual-classification framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art PLL methods.",
