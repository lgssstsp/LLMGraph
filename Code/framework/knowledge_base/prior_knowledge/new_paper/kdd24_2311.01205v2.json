While earlier studies have shown the resilience of quantized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) against BFAs, the exploration into GNNs has been limited. We introduce the Injectivity Bit Flip Attack (IBFA) specifically targeting the injective functions within GNNs to degrade their expressivity and predictive power. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of IBFA over other BFAs in degrading GNN performance across several datasets.",
