        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for globally interpretable graph learning. While most graph neural network-related research focuses on instance-specific interpretations, our project aims at capturing model-level interpretations. We introduce a Graph Distribution Matching (GDM) framework designed to create a representation of models' training trajectory by synthesizing interpretive graphs mimicking class distributions. The approach leverages maximum mean discrepancy to ensure the generated graphs could be used to train models replicating original GNN behaviors. Our framework bridges a significant gap in GNN interpretability by providing developers comprehensive insights into model behaviors.",
