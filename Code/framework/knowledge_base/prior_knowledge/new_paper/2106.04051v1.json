        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been a predominant method for node classification tasks. However, existing GNNs often rely heavily on message passing through graph structures, making them susceptible to corrupted connectivity information and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose Graph-MLP, a novel approach to graph node classification using a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) framework without explicit message passing. To capture the structural properties of graphs indirectly, we introduce the Neighboring Contrastive (NContrast) loss, which facilitates learning the underlying node relations. Extensive experiments show that Graph-MLP achieves comparable performance to GNNs with increased computational efficiency and robustness against corrupt adjacency data.",
