        "abstract": "This paper addresses the limitations of supervised learning methods for COVID-19 cough classification by presenting a novel contrastive self-supervised learning framework. The approach leverages large-scale unlabelled respiratory sounds for pre-training, which boosts the performance of downstream cough classification tasks. The framework integrates a novel random masking mechanism within the Transformer architecture and effectively utilizes ensemble learning.",
