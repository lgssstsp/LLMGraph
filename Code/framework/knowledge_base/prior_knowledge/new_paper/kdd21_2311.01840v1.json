        "abstract": "Complex data in fields like biology, neuroscience, and social networks can be modeled as attributed multi-relational graphs. This paper introduces SpectralMix, a novel algorithm for joint dimensionality reduction and spectral clustering focusing on attributed multi-relational graphs with categorical node attributes. SpectralMix maps nodes to a low-dimensional space, reducing noise and highlighting data patterns, which facilitates tasks such as clustering, outlier detection, and visualization. Our evaluation shows SpectralMix's superiority over existing methods on several real-world datasets.",
