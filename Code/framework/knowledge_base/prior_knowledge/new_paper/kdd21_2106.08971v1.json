        "abstract": "Recently, machine learning (ML) models have been widely deployed in many real-world applications. However, most ML interpretations like feature attribution typically lack reasoning capability. Counterfactuals provide a potential alternative for interpretations by showing how inputs need to be altered for desired outcomes. This paper proposes a \\textbf{\\underline{M}}odel-based \\textbf{\\underline{C}}ounterfactual \\textbf{\\underline{S}}ynthesizer (MCS) framework that captures the counterfactual universe and incorporates causal dependencies. MCS utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks and umbrella sampling to ensure accurate counterfactual generation.",
