        "abstract": "Interpretability is a key characteristic of machine learning models, particularly in socially significant decision-making areas. Rule-based models like rule lists provide easily interpretable alternatives to complex, opaque models. While effective scalable methods exist, deriving optimal rule lists remains computationally challenging, especially with large datasets. This paper introduces the SamRuLe algorithm, offering scalable learning with rigorous guarantees on approximation quality, leveraging novel upper and lower bounds for VC-dimension. Experimental results highlight the efficacy of SamRuLe in large-scale dataset scenarios, demonstrating speed advantages over exact methods and improved accuracy over heuristic methods.",
