        "abstract": "Graph data is increasingly prevalent with the rapid development of the Internet, such as social networks and citation networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) effectively model these structures, enabling various applications, from recommendation systems to molecular predictions. However, challenges persist, prompting a new knowledge distillation framework that avoids relying on deeper teacher models. This paper proposes FreeKD, a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical approach, enabling mutual knowledge distillation between shallower GNNs.",
