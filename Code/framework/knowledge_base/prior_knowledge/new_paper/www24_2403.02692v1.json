        "abstract": "This work investigates the issue of enhancing target user attacks within recommender systems by leveraging a novel Uplift-guided Budget Allocation (UBA) framework. By framing the task as an uplift modeling problem, our approach capitalizes on assigning optimal budgets for maximizing attack performance on particular user groups. Leveraging advanced CF and causal inference techniques, UBA efficiently allocates resources leading to significant improvements. Extensive evaluations depict its robustness and efficacy across multiple datasets and scenarios, introducing a new frontier for recommender system security analysis.",
