        "abstract": "Multivariate time series often feature temporal and spatial structure inherent to the domain in which they are collected. Incorporating this structure when mining such data is essential to obtaining parsimonious, robust, and interpretable models. In this paper we focus specifically on temporal data associated with the nodes of a fixed graph and refer to such data as temporal graph signals (TGS). Our goal in this work is to obtain a low-dimensional embedding of a TGS which jointly exploits such graph and temporal properties and propose a general framework for temporal graph signal decomposition (TGSD) based on joint dictionary encoding in the graph and time domain.",
