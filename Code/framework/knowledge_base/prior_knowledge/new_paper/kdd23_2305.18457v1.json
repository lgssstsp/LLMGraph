However, they often falter when faced with incomplete and insufficient graph data in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel GNN model aiming to address these challenges by incorporating effective information propagation mechanisms. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in improving accuracy on incomplete datasets.",
