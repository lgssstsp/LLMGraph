        "abstract": "This paper introduces GraphPAR, a novel framework that enhances the fairness of pre-trained graph models by implementing an adapter-tuning approach. Influenced by studies showing biases in pre-trained language models, GraphPAR aims to mitigate similar biases in pre-trained graph models by utilizing a sensitive semantic augmenter and an adapter that ensures the node representations used in downstream tasks are free of sensitive attributes' influence. Our findings show that GraphPAR maintains competitive classification performance while improving fairness.",
