        "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to provide high-quality recommendations via natural language dialogues. The scarcity of large-scale conversational datasets is a critical issue. In this paper, we present a counterfactual data simulation framework, CFCRS, which alleviates data scarcity by augmenting CRS datasets with simulated dialogues grounded on counterfactual learning. A multi-stage dialogue simulator generates coherent conversation flows based on user preferences, enhancing recommendation capacity through adversarial training with a curriculum schedule. CFCRS outperforms existing augmentation techniques, boosting the performance of competitive CRS models.",
