        "abstract": "Pre-trained transformer models have achieved great success in NLP tasks but often suffer from high computational and memory constraints. Structured pruning can offer an effective solution but may affect accuracy. We introduce {ToP}, a constraint-aware token pruning method that optimizes token removal while maintaining model efficiency and accuracy by leveraging self-attention rank distillation and fine-grained pruning strategies.",
