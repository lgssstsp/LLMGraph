        "abstract": "Recent research has investigated the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) in recommendation systems, highlighting the power of GNNs to capture complex relationships. However, data sparsity presents challenges in generating robust user and item representations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach - Robust Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCL) - that integrates adversarial robustness into the design of contrastive augmentations for GNN-based recommenders, facilitating high-quality representation learning amidst sparse data conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate RGCL's superior recommendation accuracy and model robustness when compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
