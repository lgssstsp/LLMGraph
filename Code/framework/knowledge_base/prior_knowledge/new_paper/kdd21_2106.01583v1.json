        "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently gained popularity for various graph-related tasks. However, sparsity in graph data poses challenges, especially when graphs lack sufficient observations. This paper proposes Cross-GCN learning to alleviate sparsity by transferring knowledge across multiple GCN models with partially aligned graphs. Our approach leverages parameter sharing and representation alignment to enhance node representation learning. We demonstrate effectiveness through experiments on real-world datasets.",
