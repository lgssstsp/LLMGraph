        "abstract": "In the ever-evolving landscape of online recruitment, job seekers and employers navigate a dynamic marketplace where preferences and requirements continuously shift. Unlike traditional recommendation systems, job recommendation necessitates a bidirectional understanding of matching between job seekers and employers. We propose BISTRO, a novel session-based framework designed to address user preference drift, skill refinement, and employer requirements in the online recruitment ecosystem.",
