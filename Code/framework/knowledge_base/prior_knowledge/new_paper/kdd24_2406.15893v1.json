Two innovative modeling approaches, composite models and augmented ranking models, are proposed and evaluated. These methods offer a direct probability distribution over the space of partial orders, allowing researchers to create meaningful synthetic datasets for supporting simulations and demand forecasting.",

Through comprehensive experimentation across multiple datasets, the efficacy and flexibility of these approaches are well-demonstrated.",
