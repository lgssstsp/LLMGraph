        "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the privacy vulnerabilities present in Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation models trained with mobility data. Addressing a previously overlooked attack surface, our study introduces a novel attack suite designed to assess privacy leakage risks. The suite includes data extraction and membership inference attacks, evaluating the potential privacy compromises of POI recommendation models at both location and trajectory levels. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art POI recommendation models demonstrate the significant vulnerability of these models to privacy attacks.",
