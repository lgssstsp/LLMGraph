        "abstract": "We propose DECOR, a degree-corrected social graph refinement framework for detecting fake news. Guided by the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel (DCSBM), DECOR effectively utilizes veracity-related degree patterns and co-engagement information to downweight noisy edges in social graphs, enhancing the performance of various GNN backbones. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.",
