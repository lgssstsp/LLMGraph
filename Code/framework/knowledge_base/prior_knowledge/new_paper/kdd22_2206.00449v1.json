        "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings have emerged as an effective way for a wide range of KG-based applications. While numerous approaches utilize the Euclidean geometry, recent studies show that hyperbolic geometries are more suitable for embedding hierarchical data due to their exponentially growing volumes. However, real-world KGs also exhibit heterogeneous topological structures including hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations. Current hyperbolic embedding methods struggle to capture these complex structures. We present UltraE, the first ultrahyperbolic KG embedding method, which employs an ultrahyperbolic manifold that interleaves the hyperbolic and spherical spaces. Our framework enables simultaneous embedding of hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations with relation-specific geometric mappings and complex relational patterns inference. UltraE achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for KG completion tasks, outperforming previous Euclidean and non-Euclidean approaches.",
