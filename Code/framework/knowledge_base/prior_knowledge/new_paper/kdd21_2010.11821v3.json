SCC utilizes best-first, bottom-up hierarchical agglomerative clustering techniques with enhancements in linkage functions and reducing over-merging issues. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we validate SCC's performance as both a hierarchical clustering tool and a flat clustering method encompassing a novel approximation approach to the DP-Means objective.",
