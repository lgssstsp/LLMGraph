        "abstract": "In this paper, we redefine GRU as differential equation that reflect past observations to the current hidden state for processing continuously generalizing GRU. We propose a continuous-time bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) network based on neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) and train it with explicit time-derivative regularizations, thus addressing the inherent prediction delay observed in various time series forecasting models. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose CONTIME By continuously extending the bi-directional GRU, we present a novel architecture that facilitates the supervision of the time-derivative of observations in the continuous time domain. We conduct time series forecasting with minimal prediction delays through our proposed time-derivative regularization. CONTIME demonstrates outstanding performance in addressing the prediction delay across all 6 benchmark datasets. In addition to minimizing the prediction delay, it excels in all three metrics (TDI, DTW, and MSE). Our code is available at this link https://github.com/sheoyon-jhin/CONTIME.",
