        "abstract": "With the rapid trend of digitalization in clinical systems, a large accumulation of clinical time-series data has attracted research attention from both computer science and medicine. This paper introduces Warpformer, a novel approach for multi-scale analysis of irregularly sampled clinical time series, addressing challenges posed by intra-series irregularity and inter-series discrepancy. Warpformer effectively captures temporal patterns by introducing a unique input representation and combining warping modules with doubly self-attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Warpformer compared to state-of-the-art methods on commonly used datasets like PhysioNet and MIMIC-III.",
