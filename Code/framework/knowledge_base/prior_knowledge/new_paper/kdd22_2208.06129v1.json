        "abstract": "We propose a novel Graph Convolutional Network, called \\system, for tackling the representation learning problem on attributed multiplex heterogeneous networks (AMHENs). Our approach effectively captures multi-relational topological dependencies by decoupling such networks into multiple homogeneous and bipartite sub-networks. Inspired by the graph neural networks (GNNs), \\system further aggregates these sub-networks for effective embedding learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in downstream tasks such as link prediction and node classification.",
