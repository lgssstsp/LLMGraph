We propose novel alignment approaches to leverage the explainability of LLMs for complex systems. By incorporating behavior alignment, intention alignment, and hybrid alignment, we enhance the comprehensibility of predictive behaviors in recommender systems. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in generating insightful explanations and advancing the field of explainable AI.",
