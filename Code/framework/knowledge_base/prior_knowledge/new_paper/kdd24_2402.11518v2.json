        "abstract": "Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) allow for joint modeling of network topology and multi-typed relations, making them essential in various applications. Despite advancements using meta-paths and meta-structures in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), challenges remain in scaling up meta-structure discovery without domain expertise. This paper introduces \\emph{ReStruct}, a novel framework combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms to improve meta-structure search. Extensive experiments reveal state-of-the-art performance on recommendation and node classification tasks across diverse datasets. Furthermore, human evaluations suggest superior explainability of our discovered meta-structures.",
