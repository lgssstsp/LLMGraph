By introducing the concept of dynamic projected gradient descent, MiBTack minimizes the adversarial budget needed for misclassification of nodes, presenting new insights into the adversarial robustness of GNNs. Our method is shown to achieve 100% attack success with minimal perturbations across multiple GNN architectures.",
