        "abstract": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) represents a quintessential challenge in combinatorial optimization, traditionally focused on theoretical or arbitrarily constructed instances. Recent progress in neural network solutions has shifted attention towards more practical scenarios. This work proposes a methodology designed to more closely simulate realistic TSP instances using real-world geographic data, highlighting potential gaps and opportunities in current neural TSP approaches.",
