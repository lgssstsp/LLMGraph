We demonstrate that the perturbations of several existing attacks are linearly separable and propose a method to generate synthetic perturbations, proving that linearly-separable perturbations are a sufficient condition for such attacks. Our method is computationally efficient and reveals the vulnerability of deep networks to spurious features.",
