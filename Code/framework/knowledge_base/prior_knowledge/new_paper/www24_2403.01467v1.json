        "abstract": "We introduce GraphCTA, a novel framework for source-free unsupervised graph domain adaptation. This method addresses the domain discrepancies and source hypothesis bias in adapting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GraphCTA combines model adaptation and graph adaptation techniques, leveraging memory banks and neighborhood contrastive learning to enhance performance on target graphs without requiring source data access. Our experiments reveal GraphCTA's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art source-dependent methods across multiple scenarios.",
