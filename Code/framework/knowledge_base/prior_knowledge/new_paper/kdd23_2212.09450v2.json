        "abstract": "In recent years, the development of neural networks for drug discovery has attracted significant attention. Our proposed method, LSSAMP, incorporates structure information into the generative model to expedite antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery. Utilizing the Latent Sequence-Structure model, we map sequence features and secondary structures into a unified latent space, generating peptides with optimal sequence compositions and structures. A multi-scale vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) enables fine-grained control, capturing diverse patterns in sequences and structures, ultimately accelerating AMP discovery.",
