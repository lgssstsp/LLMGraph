Our approach reformulates logical reasoning as a masked prediction problem, leveraging general knowledge from pre-trained models in a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate \\method's capability of answering complex logical queries, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches on widely-used benchmark datasets.",
