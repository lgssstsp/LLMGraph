        "abstract": "Table2Charts proposes an innovative approach for recommending charts by learning patterns of chart creation and utilizing a table-to-sequence(s) generation model. It addresses common challenges in chart creation including inefficiencies in design separation and data imbalances. Our method leverages state-of-the-art DQNs with copying mechanisms to enhance recommendation quality and supports functionalities for both single- and multi-type chart recommendation tasks efficiently.",
