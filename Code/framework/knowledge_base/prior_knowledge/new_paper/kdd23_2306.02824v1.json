By proposing a decision-tree-based differentiable gating mechanism, the paper aims to offer an alternative to existing non-differentiable methods while maintaining computational efficiency. A permutation-based local search method is also presented to address initialization challenges associated with Sparse-MoE systems.",

        "comparisons with related methods": "The proposed COMET approach improves upon the existing Sparse-MoE frameworks by enhancing stability and convergence through differentiable gating, outperforming non-differentiable gates in our experiments. By introducing a tree-based gating mechanism, the method provides a systematic way to enforce cardinality constraints, which is a limitation in methods like Top-k gating or random routing. The permutation-based local search, unlike standard brute-force local searches, is differentiable, thus enabling smoother optimization paths towards higher-quality solutions."
