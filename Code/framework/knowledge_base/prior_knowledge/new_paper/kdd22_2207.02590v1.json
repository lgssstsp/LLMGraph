        "abstract": "The study addresses urban morphology generation by proposing MetroGAN, a GAN model incorporating geographical knowledge to simulate urban cities. It effectively handles the challenge of sparse data inherent in urban settings, stabilizing the training process and enhancing performance by integrating progressive growing structures and geographical constraints. MetroGAN can generate city morphology based on physical geographic features alone and offers a novel evaluation framework beyond pixel-level accuracy, comparing urban systems on spatial, perceptual, and macroscopic levels. Experimental results validate its superiority over existing models, showing promise for urban simulation and data augmentation.",
