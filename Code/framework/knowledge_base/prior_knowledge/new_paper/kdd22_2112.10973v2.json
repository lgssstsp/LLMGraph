        "abstract": "The explosion of data available from metagenomic studies has spurred the development of novel computational techniques to handle exceedingly complex microbial communities. A primary task in metagenomics is to reconstruct individual genomes from mixed datasets. This paper presents two significant advancements in this field: the introduction of sparse dominating sets that optimize the partitioning of metagenome assembly graphs and algorithms that ensure balanced neighborhood partitioning of such graphs. Extensive theoretical analyses, coupled with empirical studies on real-world datasets, demonstrate both the practicality and superiority of our proposed methods compared to existing tools.",
