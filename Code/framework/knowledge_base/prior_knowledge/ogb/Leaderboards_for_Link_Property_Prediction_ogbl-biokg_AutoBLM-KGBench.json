    "Paper Summary": "The paper presents two automated approaches, AutoBLM and AutoBLM+, for designing scoring functions in knowledge graph (KG) learning, focusing on model design. These methods aim to discover better bilinear scoring functions through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques, addressing the complexities and specific properties of KGs.\n\n### Key Design Aspects:\n\n1. **Search Space Design**:\n   - The authors construct a search space for bilinear models (BLMs) by categorizing existing scoring functions and analyzing their properties. This space allows for the exploration of various scoring functions tailored to specific tasks.\n   - The scoring functions are represented in a unified way, allowing for various existing models (e.g., DistMult, ComplEx) to be easily compared and analyzed in terms of their effectiveness.\n\n2. **Progressive and Evolutionary Algorithms**:\n   - **AutoBLM**: Utilizes a progressive search algorithm that incrementally builds scoring functions, starting from simpler structures with fewer parameters and expanding as needed. This approach aims to enhance efficiency and effectiveness by refining structures that are less complex at stages of the search.\n   - **AutoBLM+**: Enhances AutoBLM by incorporating an evolutionary algorithm. This allows for a more flexible exploration of scoring functions, enabling the model to adapt and optimize its structure based on performance feedback.\n   - Both algorithms employ a filter to prune degenerate structures (those that do not provide meaningful information) and a performance predictor that leverages symmetry-related features to gauge the potential effectiveness of candidate structures.\n\n3. **Bilinear Model Representation**:\n   - The scoring functions are structured in a way that models the plausible interactions between entities and relations within the KG. The design includes an analysis of expressiveness, ensuring that the models can capture a variety of relation patterns specific to the given KG.\n\n4. **Customization to Domain-Specific Properties**:\n   - The methods are tailored to incorporate relationships and properties specific to the domain of the KGs being modeled. This focus enables the scoring functions to reflect the intricate nature of entity relationships more accurately.\n\n5. **Handling of Degeneration and Equivalence**:\n   - The paper details techniques to detect and avoid degenerate structures, ensuring that the search process remains focused on viable scoring functions. The authors define equivalence conditions that allow for the elimination of redundant structures that yield the same performance.\n\n6. **Flexibility and Adaptability**:\n   - AutoBLM+ is highlighted for its increased flexibility as it explores diverse structures within the same computational budget. This adaptability is crucial for effectively modeling the variety of relational patterns encountered in different KGs.\n\nIn summary, the methods presented in this paper represent significant advances in the automated design of scoring functions for KG learning by leveraging structured search spaces, evolutionary techniques, and domain-specific features to optimize model performance."
